    <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Nicole and I’ve wanted to be an Engineer since I was in 8th grade. I’ve always been drawn towards science and math
        and worked hard to excel at it. Fast forward five years later and I started my academic career at College of DuPage to work
        towards an Associate degree in Engineering Science. A couple years later, I transferred to Illinois Institute of Technology
        with the goal to learn and absorb as much as possible. After doing my general electives, I was excited to jump right into my
        core engineering courses. I’m a 4th year Mechanical Engineering student nearing the end of my career at IIT and I’m excited to
        apply the knowledge I have obtained to my future career.

    <h2>Career Interests</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond IIT, I’m planning on using my degree to pursue a career where I will change the world. My dream as an Engineer is to make
        a difference. For a while, I didn’t know what that meant. At first, this to me meant that I could develop something entirely new for
        the world.Then, it shifted towards a focus on the environment. I previously worked at Argonne National Laboratory for an internship
        where I was exposed to research on nuclear power plants and energy systems. It has become increasingly important to me that I have a
        career in renewable energy and sustainability. Recently, I worked for BP using drones and working within their pipelines group doing
        data integrity. I am hoping that through my internship experiences, that I find myself in a career where I have projects involving
        renewable energy or manufacturing/designing sustainable products. With the combination of my knowledge in engineering and future
        experience, I want to make a difference for the world.
