      <p>
        I am Nicole Amon, a motivated and driven individual with any task given to me.
        I have been an asset at each internship I have worked at. For example, my precise and analytical skills
        were essential when I worked at Argonne National Laboratory. I helped draft and write on large reports to
        help illustrate the work of the group. My next internship was with BP where I helped modernize and check
        massive sets of data on file. My final deliverables included methods and steps to increase the efficiency
        of individuals who access the data every day. I am proud of my solid track record of delivering projects that
        had proven great business benefits and I constantly strive to learn more and further my skills. I want to work
        for a company that I can strive to do so.
