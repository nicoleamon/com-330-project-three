    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>
      I am Nicole Amon and I am a motivated and driven individual with any task given to me.
      I have been an asset at each internship I have worked at. For example, my precise and analytical skills
      were essential when I worked at Argonne National Laboratory. I helped draft and write on large reports to
      help illustrate the work of the group. My next internship was with BP where I helped modernize and check
      massive sets of data on file. My final deliverables included methods and steps to increase the efficiency
      of individuals who access the data every day. I am proud of my solid track record of delivering projects that
      had proven great business benefits and I constantly strive to learn more and further my skills. I want to work
      for a company that I can strive to do so.
